Mutualism is a kind of symbiotic relationship that occurs in nature, in which both species benefit from each other’s interaction. It’s a common type of ecological interaction.

We believe that our economy today doesn’t function in a very ecological way, given the climate crisis that derives from it, especially since the industrial revolution, whose approach is to compartmentalise knowledge and industry streams for the highest efficiency of individual silos, considering impacts on the commons as externalities.

Mutualistic arrangements, instead, are most likely to develop between organisms with widely different living requirements - like the clownfish and the anemone - proving that the compartmentalised approach fails in seeing useful connections across and within silos that can help us save on resources, by reusing each other’s efforts, and make our economy more efficient and clean, for the benefit of the whole system and ecosystem.

We advocate a new approach to the economy, that is circular, open, collaborative and systemic by design. In order to reach that vision, we aim at exploring mutual relationships across and within industries, that can enable a more intertwined economic system. This might be especially viable in the digital and public sector.
